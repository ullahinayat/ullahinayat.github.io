Welcome to my personal website!

I am currently based in Seoul, South Korea where I work as an ISEF Research Fellow at the Environmental Planning Research Institute (EPI), Seoul National University (SNU). Before joining SNU, I worked as Assistant Professor, at the National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST) Pakistan. I received Ph.D in Public Policy from the Korea Development Institute (KDI), School of Public Policy and Management under the Global Ambassador’s Scholarship Program.

I primarily work with impact evaluation methods in experimental and quasi-experimental settings that help policy analysts assess the effectiveness of government policies in an unbiased way. My doctoral dissertation comprised three essays focusing on evaluating the impact of development interventions on education and sustainable development outcomes in developing countries. For instance, in my JMP, we find ideal conditions for a natural experiment  that allowed us to establish a causal relationship between a technology-based externally controlled schools' monitoring program and improvements in learning outcomes  in the KP province, Pakistan. We apply various techniques, including difference-in-differences, event study, and instrumental variables to causally attribute effects to the program. Recently, the working paper of this research has received the Innovative Policy Best Paper Award from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the International Economic Association (IEA) for the year 2023. This prestigious award, with a prize of $7,000, was formally presented during the ADB-IEA award session at the 2023 ADB Annual Meeting on May 5th, 2023 (the announcement is available at https://events.development.asia/learning-events/winners-2023-adb-iea-innovative-policy-research-award).

As a researcher, I seek to scientifically answer three important questions: 

* Whether changes in the well-being of individuals and groups are genuinely attributed to a particular project, program, or policy?
* What type of program or policy do governments need to enhance the human capital in a sustainable way? 
* How to make best use of scientific knowledge for existing societies and generations to come?
